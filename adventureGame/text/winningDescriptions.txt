The witches look at your items with suspicion, but decide to go through with the incantation of the spell: 
 
   "Take lizard's leg and owlet's wing,  
   And hair of cat that used to sing. 
   In the cauldron they all shall go;  
   Stirring briskly, to and fro. 
   When the color is of a hog,    Add eye of newt and toe of frog.     Bubble all i' the charmed pot; 
   Bubble all 'til good and hot. 
   Pour the broth into a cup of stone, 
   And stir it well with a mummy's bone." 
 
You take the resulting broth offered to you and drink... As the fog clears, you find yourself at a computer terminal;  your adventure is at an end.
